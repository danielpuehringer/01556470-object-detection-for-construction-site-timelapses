# Scalable object detection for construction site images for timelapse videos
A student project by [Daniel Martin PÃ¼hringer](dapinger.at/cv) @ [TU Vienna](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/) for the course [Applied Deep Learning(194.077)](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/educationDetails.xhtml?dswid=9885&dsrid=874&semester=2025W&courseNr=194077) by [Alexander Pacha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apacha/).

## Description
This project aims to helping users to save time on their generation of timelapse videos of construction sites.

### Problem
Since timelapse videos of construction sites require best suited images (approx. 1200 for a one minute video) of large image datasets, video producers have to manually view all images and select only a small percentage (approx. 5%) which seem to be the most suitable ones for a timelapse video.

### Idea and proposed solution
In order to provide value to users, CNNs could be applied to pre-select interesting images which indicate a high amount of activity (i.e. many people/construction vehicles on a picture) and help user to pre-select suitable images for a given dataset of construction sites to reduce the production time of timelapse videos.
